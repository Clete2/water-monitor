# Introduction
This project is a demonstration of a water monitor that I created for my sump pump. Below I provide directions to use Docker to stand up a grafana / influxdb setup. Then, I will walk through the details of setting up your Raspberry Pi, telegraf, the water sensor, graphing, and alerting on the results.
