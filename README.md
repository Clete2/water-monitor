# Introduction
This project has been created to assist you in building your own solution to monitor your sump pump or any other water level and receive alerts based on a threshold that you control.

I have personally chosen the following stack for this project, but you can choose whatever you are most comfortable with.
- [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org)
  - Breadboard, GPIO breakout board, power supply, wires, and microSD card
- [Milone Technologies eTape](https://milonetech.com/products/standard-etape-assembly) water level sensor with standard assembly and voltage divider (24")
- [Adafruit ADS1015](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1083) analog to digital signal converter to read the water level sensor
